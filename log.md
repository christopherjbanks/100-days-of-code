# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: September 6, 2021

**Today**

Took a day off the juliacodes project to continue picking up some D3 via the Shirley Wu course, though, frankly am wondering about spreading myself too thin between this, basic React and my attempts to learn three.js too. Think it's justified through building the svg animation and applied greensock later though.

### Day 5: September 5, 2021

**Today**

Continuing to slowly get through the FEM Gatsby course and play along with a reverse-engineer of the juliacodes site.

**Thoughts**

I'm only spending an hour or so a day on this, so again progress feels frustratingly slow. Outlined the skills section, though there's still something buggy happening on the image load, which doesn't appear smooth on the first load. Guessing this is just due to image size and it seems like Gatsby has useful functionality for dynamically adjusting the image, so that's next on the list.

### Day 4: September 4, 2021

**Today**

Continuing to slowly get through the FEM Gatsby course and play along with a reverse-engineer of the juliacodes site.

**Thoughts**

Some interesting things learned, like using 'forwards' on a CSS animation means that you can't go on to later change that same value on the element.

### Day 3: September 3, 2021

**Today**

Continuing to slowly get through the FEM Gatsby course and play along with a reverse-engineer of the juliacodes site.

**Thoughts**

It's coming along slower than my usual, but to be expected. Also good practice regardless and nice to get the Netlify site up and working.

### Day 2: September 2, 2021

**Today**

Setting up a project that might take a couple of days. Time spent mainly reviewing the Gatsby intro course on FEM, starting up skeleton app. Project intention is to clone juliacodes.com, then iterate thereafter.

**Thoughts**

Gatsby seems really useful and fast -- I've tried deploying through Digital Ocean and setting up nginx etc, and the JAMstack seems like it will be waaay easier. Need to do more code though. Also excited to tighten my CSS, which is a little boring, but important.

### Day 1: September 1, 2021

**Today**

Reproduction of the Netflix tile example in CSS via the Wealthfront blog.

**Thoughts**

Useful to get back into the swing of vanilla CSS/Javascript. Would like to refactor in React and make dynamic (ie add hover function to all tiles and make the JS code more flexible).

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
