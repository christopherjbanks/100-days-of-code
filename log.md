# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: September 2, 2021

**Today**

Setting up a project that might take a couple of days. Time spent mainly reviewing the Gatsby intro course on FEM, starting up skeleton app. Project intention is to clone juliacodes.com, then iterate thereafter.

**Thoughts**

Gatsby seems really useful and fast -- I've tried deploying through Digital Ocean and setting up nginx etc, and the JAMstack seems like it will be waaay easier. Need to do more code though. Also excited to tighten my CSS, which is a little boring, but important.

### Day 1: September 1, 2021

**Today**

Reproduction of the Netflix tile example in CSS via the Wealthfront blog.

**Thoughts**

Useful to get back into the swing of vanilla CSS/Javascript. Would like to refactor in React and make dynamic (ie add hover function to all tiles and make the JS code more flexible).

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
