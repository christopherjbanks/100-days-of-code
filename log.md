# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2021

**Today**

Reproduction of the Netflix tile example in CSS via the Wealthfront blog.

**Thoughts**

Useful to get back into the swing of vanilla CSS/Javascript. Would like to refactor in React and make dynamic (ie add hover function to all tiles and make the JS code more flexible).

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
